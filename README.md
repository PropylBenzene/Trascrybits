Simple project to show you can split an MP3 into 15 second sessions, and then loop through each point.

USEAGE

You need to install Ruby, mplayer, and mp3splt. All are open source, cross platform, so if there are issues, I'll fix it.

Yes the code is sloppy, you don't like it, tip me or fork it ;)

ruby type.rb [DIR NAME] [MP3 FILE]

DIR NAME should be the name of the directory you want to dump this out to, next revision will be automatic based on file name. 

MP3 FILE is the mp3 file name. Please make this an absolute path.

Only accepts lower case for now in responses.

r = repeat, c = continue.
